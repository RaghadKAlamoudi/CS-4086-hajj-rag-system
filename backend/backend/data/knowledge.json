For men, Ihram clothing consists of two white unstitched pieces of cloth - one wrapped around the waist (Izar) and one draped over the shoulder (Rida). Women wear modest clothing covering the entire body except the face and hands. The state of Ihram begins with the intention (Niyyah) and recitation of Talbiyah at the Miqat boundary.",

There are several types: Tawaf al-Qudum (arrival tawaf - Sunnah), Tawaf al-Ifadah (obligatory pillar), and Tawaf al-Wida (farewell tawaf - obligatory for non-Makkah residents). Each circuit begins and ends at the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad). Pilgrims should be in a state of wudu (ablution). Men should perform first three circuits at a brisk pace (Raml) and uncover right shoulder (Idtiba). After Tawaf, pray two rakahs at Maqam Ibrahim.",

Men should run between the two green lights (Raml). This ritual reminds pilgrims of Hajar's trust in Allah and her perseverance. The Zamzam well miraculously appeared after this trial.",
